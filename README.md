# Smart Walking Companion for Visually Impaired People

## Project Overview
The **Smart Walking Companion** is an AI-powered assistive system designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate safely and independently.  
The system combines **computer vision**, **IoT sensors**, and a **mobile application** to detect obstacles, assist with navigation, and provide emergency support.

This project was developed as a **Senior Engineering Project**.

## Objectives
- Detect obstacles such as stairs, sidewalks, potholes, traffic lights, and doors
- Provide real-time audio alerts to the user
- Assist navigation using GPS and voice guidance
- Detect falls and trigger emergency alerts automatically
- Improve safety and independence for visually impaired users
